Never Have I Ever
Made by MisoMikke.

Never have I ever is a popular party game in which players ask about things others have not done.
  If a player has done the said thing, they have to say they have done it/ take a drink,
  or something that has been agreed on.

This program is made using python and is used to ask the user questions in the game of never have I ever.
  The program displays rules on startup if user needs to see them. When game starts,
  the program asks a question and waits users input if they want to continue or quit.
  Continuing the game means more random quesions from an array, quitting exits the program.

The questions are either written by me or gathered from the web.
  I needed as many questions as possible and some may be bad.
  The questions are nsfw, and may make players unconfortable. Skip any question you may not want to use.
  Player may not answer if they don't want to.

I do not encourage to do actions featured in the questions, or support bad behaviour.
  If you're playing the game as a drinking game, remember to drink responsibly!
  The game is only for having fun, it's is not for bullying, incriminating or harassment.
  I have not done criminal actions listed in the questions, and I am not associated with people who have done such.

Have fun.
